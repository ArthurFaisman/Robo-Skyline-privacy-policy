**Last updated:** [insert date]

### 1. Who I Am

This privacy policy applies to **[Your Full Name]**, a private individual acting in a purely personal capacity (not as a business or organization).

For any questions about this policy, you can contact me at: **[your email address]**.

---

### 2. Summary

- **No personal data collected**: I do not intentionally collect, store, or process any personal data about you.
- **No tracking**: I do not use cookies, analytics, tracking pixels, or social media plugins.
- **No sharing or selling**: I do not sell, rent, or share any personal data with anyone, because I do not collect it in the first place.

---

### 3. Data I Do Not Collect

When you access my content (for example, by visiting a website I control):

- **No personal data is collected by me.**
- I do **not**:
  - Create user accounts or profiles
  - Collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or postal addresses
  - Track your browsing behavior across sites
  - Build marketing or advertising profiles

---

### 4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies

- **I do not set or use cookies.**
- **I do not use analytics tools** (such as Google Analytics, Matomo, etc.).
- **I do not use advertising or marketing trackers.**

If your browser shows cookies while accessing my content, they are not created or controlled by me, but may be related to your browser, device, or network.

### 5. Third-Party Infrastructure (e.g. Hosting, ISPs)

Even though **I do not process your data**, some **technical data may be processed by third parties** that provide the infrastructure needed to deliver my content, such as:

- Your **internet service provider (ISP)**
- My **web hosting provider** or any content delivery network (CDN)

These third parties may, for example, temporarily log technical information such as:

- IP address
- Date and time of access
- URL requested
- Browser type and version
- Operating system

This processing is done **for their own purposes** (such as ensuring security, preventing abuse, and maintaining their services) and is **not controlled by me**. Please refer to their own privacy policies for details.

### 6. Communications You Initiate

If you choose to contact me directly (for example, by sending me an email or message):

- I will receive the information you choose to provide (such as your name, email address, and the content of your message).
- I will **only use this information to read, respond to, and manage your communication.**
- I do not add it to any database, share it, or use it for marketing.
- I will keep such communications only as long as reasonably needed (for example, to handle your request or keep necessary records) and then delete them.

---

### 7. Your Rights

Because I **do not systematically collect or store personal data about visitors**, in most cases there is no personal data of yours for me to access, correct, or delete.

If you believe I hold personal data about you (for example, in emails you have sent):

- You may contact me at **[your email address]** and request:
  - **Access** to the personal data I hold about you
  - **Correction** of inaccurate personal data
  - **Deletion** of your personal data (where applicable)

I will respond as soon as reasonably possible.

---

### 8. Changes to This Policy

If I ever change how I handle data (for example, if I start using analytics or collecting information), **I will update this privacy policy before doing so**.

The most recent version of this policy will always be available at **[location/URL where this policy is published]**.

---

### 9. Legal Disclaimer

This privacy policy is intended to be **simple and transparent** and to reflect the fact that **I am a private individual who does not process others’ data, except minimally when you contact me directly.**

It is **not legal advice**. Privacy and data protection laws can vary by country and situation. If you need a privacy policy for a business, organization, or a more complex project, you should consult a qualified legal professional.
